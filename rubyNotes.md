  ## Teaching yourself the material for COSC 630

  # 1. Introduction to Ruby
    -- If you do not have too much basic computer science experience...getting familiar with just Ruby as a language and basic programming concepts could be helpful. Otherwise you may want to skip or skim through this tutorial to just get familiar with a new language. This tutorial is strictly about Ruby outside of Rails and any Web development. I suggest following through the tutorial and trying some of the examples in an IDE or text editor of your choice. This tutorial suggests Atom which I also believe is a good tool for the job.
